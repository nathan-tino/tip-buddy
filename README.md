# TipBuddy

This is the front-end of TipBuddy: a tool to help servers and bartenders keep track of their tips. It is not yet finished, the UI needs some polishing, but it functions and interacts with the server (TipBuddyAPI).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
